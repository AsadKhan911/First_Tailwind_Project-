# Facebook Login Page Clone (2024 Version) - Tailwind CSS Project

Welcome to my Facebook Login Page Clone project, showcasing the 2024 version. This project is based on my learning from a tutorial created in 2021, but I've revamped and updated it to reflect the current design of the Facebook login page as of 2024.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in using Tailwind CSS to create a modern and responsive user interface. It's a reimagined version of the Facebook login page, incorporating the latest design trends and elements.
